Line-by-Line Explanation:
🔹 Line 1:

int failCount = 0;
Purpose: Keeps track of consecutive fail events within the 5-minute window.

🔹 Line 2:

int firstFailMinutes = -1;
Purpose: Stores the time (in total minutes since midnight) of the first fail in the current fail sequence.

Initial value: -1 indicates that no fail has been recorded yet.

🔹 Line 3:

int i = 0;
Purpose: Index used to manually parse the input string character by character.

🔹 Line 4:

while (i < input.Length)
Purpose: Loops through the entire input string until all events have been processed.

🔹 Line 5–8:

string action = "";
while (i < input.Length && input[i] != '@')
{
    action += input[i];
    i++;
}
Purpose: Parses the action part ("fail" or "success") from the current event string.

Stops reading when it hits the @ symbol.

🔹 Line 9:

i++; // Skip '@'
Purpose: Skips the '@' to begin parsing the timestamp.

🔹 Line 10:
int hour = (input[i] - '0') * 10 + (input[i + 1] - '0');
Purpose: Extracts the hour part of the timestamp by converting characters to digits.

🔹 Line 11:

i += 3; // Skip "HH:"
Purpose: Skips the hour digits and the colon ':'.

🔹 Line 12:

int minute = (input[i] - '0') * 10 + (input[i + 1] - '0');
Purpose: Extracts the minute part of the timestamp.

🔹 Line 13:

i += 2;
Purpose: Advances the index past the minute part.

🔹 Line 14–15:

if (i < input.Length && input[i] == ',') i++;
Purpose: If a comma is present, move to the next event.

🔹 Line 16:

int currentMinutes = hour * 60 + minute;
Purpose: Converts the full timestamp (HH:MM) to total minutes since midnight, which makes time comparisons easy.

🔹 Line 17–21:

if (action == "success")
{
    failCount = 0;
    firstFailMinutes = -1;
}
Purpose: If the login was successful:

Reset the fail count and fail timestamp.

🔹 Line 22:

else if (action == "fail")
Purpose: If the action was a failure, check for locking conditions.

🔹 Line 23–26:

if (failCount == 0)
{
    failCount = 1;
    firstFailMinutes = currentMinutes;
}
Purpose: If this is the first fail, start a new fail sequence.

🔹 Line 27–37:

else
{
    if (currentMinutes - firstFailMinutes <= 5)
    {
        failCount++;
        if (failCount == 3)
        {
            string lockedTime = ((hour < 10) ? "0" : "") + hour.ToString() + ":" +
                                ((minute < 10) ? "0" : "") + minute.ToString();
            return "LOCKED at " + lockedTime;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        failCount = 1;
        firstFailMinutes = currentMinutes;
    }
}
Explanation:

If this fail happened within 5 minutes of the first fail:

Increment the fail count.

If this is the third fail, return "LOCKED at HH:MM".

If it’s outside the 5-minute window:

Start a new fail sequence with the current fail.

🔹 Line 38:

return "OK";
Purpose: If no lock condition is met after all events are processed, return "OK".
