Question:01
you are tasked with building a login attempt tracker for a system that locksusers out after 3 consecutive failed login attempts within a 5 minute window.

Track consecutive "fail" attempts.

if there are 3 fails within 5 minutes return-LOCKED at<time of 3rd fail>

If the attempts dont meet the lock criteria, return - OK 

RUles:
A "Success" resets the failure count
timestamps are in chronological order
you cannot use collections like array or lists
you must manually parse timestamps.
do not use DateTime.Parse,split(),or LINQ

Example1:
Input: "success@10:00,fail@10:01,fail@10:05,success@10:10"
Output:"LOCKED at 10:05"

Example2:
Input: "fail@10:00,fail@10:06,success@10:07"
Output:"OK"

Example3:
Input: "fail@09:55,fail@09:56,success@09:58,fail@10:01,fail@10:04"
Output:"LOCKED at 10:04"
